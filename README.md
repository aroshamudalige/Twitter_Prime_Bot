Run MyBot.java class file.
Then tweet the bot I created (@IamAbot94) with an integer.
  Ex "@IamAbot94 50".
Then the bot will reply with a list of prime numbers less than the given value.

As I have deployed this on openshift you can simply post a tweet like "@IamAbot94 <INTEGER>" and get the reply.
